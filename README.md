This is the current home of a 3D "engine" (layer) I'm working on for Butano. It will tentatively be used for a new game using Paper Mario style rendering, and possibly even a Paper Mario demake/port itself. (Note for legal, no copyrighted PM assets will be shared.) The very versatile LinkSystem subsystem is much more approachable and will hopefully be used with a variety of homebrew games.

### Licensing / Contributing (⚠️)
A little different than most repos on GitHub, so pay extra attention. Technically speaking, code is _source-available_, not open source.
- If you contribute to any part of the codebase, you get MIT-equivalent rights to the whole thing: free, no-royalties access to everything forever, commercial or otherwise.
- If you want to use the engine but for whatever reason can't / don't want to contribute, you can ask for a manual license to use it. Manual licenses are case-by-case, currently free, and may include revenue-sharing in the future.

As for crediting the engine, it's only if it is used on the GBA in mostly original form. If you have received the manual license, you are not allowed to use the codebase for any other target platform or make substantial modifications anyway, so crediting is required. If you want to make substantial modifications, why not put in a PR & get contributor rights?

That being said, basically the idea is if you want the engine to improve and you have the skills to do it, you should feel encouraged to do so, knowing that you'll be able to use what you make (and what your friends make) for other stuff in the future.
And if you just want to use the engine as-is, then all you have to do is say 'please' :)

### About the Docs
Since LinkSystem is about done (classic message passing), this repo will be home first to a tutorial on how game networking works, as well as how to use the API. Should get you excited about networking your game, and ofc I can help you make your GBA game multiplayer if you'd like to work with me ;)
