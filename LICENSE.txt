This software and its source code (the “Software”) are licensed under the
following terms.

1. Definitions

“Contributor” means any individual or entity that has made a non-trivial
contribution of source code to this repository which has been accepted and
merged.

“Target Platform” means the Nintendo Game Boy Advance (GBA).

2. Rights Granted to Contributors (MIT-Equivalent Grant)

If you are a Contributor, you are granted a perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, modify, and distribute
the Software for personal or commercial purposes, including creating
and selling games using the engine, without additional permission.

On platforms other than the Target Platform (GBA), Contributors may
freely sublicense, sell, or distribute derivative works without restriction.

On the Target Platform (GBA) only:
- Any derivative work that is largely intact or clearly recognizable as this engine
may not be sublicensed, sold, or licensed as an engine without the joint permission
of the copyright holders of the parent project and any fork contributors.
- Forks of forks are not allowed unless contributing back to the original fork
or the top-level repository.
- Contributors retain copyright in their own code, but the copyright holders
retain exclusive authority over licensing the engine.

Each Contributor grants the copyright holder(s) a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free
license to use, modify, relicense, and distribute their contributions under any terms.

3. Attribution Requirements

If the Software is:
- Used primarily on the Target Platform (GBA), and
- Retains its identity as this engine or a clearly recognizable derivative,

then attribution to this project and its author(s) is required in a visible
form (e.g., documentation, credits screen, or repository README).

If the Software is substantially modified, partially reused, or ported to
another platform, attribution is optional and left to the user’s discretion.

4. Non-Contributors

If you are not a Contributor, no rights are granted under this license by default.

Non-Contributors must obtain an explicit license from the copyright holder before
using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software.

Limited Exception.
Non-Contributors are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license
to view, compile, and modify the Software solely for evaluation and submitting
contributions for inclusion in the repository.

At the time of writing, usage licenses are granted free of charge upon request,
but this is not guaranteed and may change in the future.
